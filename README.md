# Basic Graph Algorithms

This repo covers basic graph algorithms for directed and undirected graphs with/without weights on edges.

Base graph data structure is targeted for sparse graphs. For example, it maintains adjancy list and pointrs.

Main objective behind this is purely educational. 

It has quite a bit of room for improvement. Feel free to reach out if you spot weakness, bug or enancement.
