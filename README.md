# Basic Graph Algorithms

## Introduction

This repo covers basic graph algorithms for directed and undirected graphs with/without weights on edges.

Base graph data structure is targeted for **sparse graphs**. For example, it maintains adjancy list and pointrs.

Main objective behind this repository is purely educational.

## Graph Format


```
graph (un)directed`
<node-x> <node-y> [edge-weight]
```

***Example Graph File*** 
```
graph directed
n1 n2 2
n1 n3 4
n2 n3 1
n2 n4 4
n2 n5 2
n3 n5 3
n4 n6 2
n5 n4 3
n5 n6 2
```


## Summary

It has quite a bit of room for improvement. Feel free to reach out if you spot weakness, bug, enancement or simply a suggestion.
